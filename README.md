## JS Frameworks CA
This will serve as my JS Frameworks Report & Rationale. Throughout the document, I will detail my coding choices, the work process, as well as the design choices I made.

This report will be short and simple.

I chose React as I want to create my own learning plan for TypeScript.

For state management, I opted for Zustand. I really enjoyed working with it; it's simple and easy to come up with solutions to my problems. There isn't a whole lot to explain in text about what I did, but the basic state management functions like session storage and total price were covered using Zustand.

For my form, I decided to go the basic route. Although you provided lessons on React Hook Form, since this was a rather simple project, I stuck with what I know. For my personal projects, I will consider using a framework.

Additionally, I added a simple notification using React-Toastify.

In summary, this project was fun. It was my first time building a simple shopping cart. In the future, I plan to work more on this to find smarter and more future-proof solutions for building e-commerce applications.
